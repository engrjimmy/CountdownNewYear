If you would like to countdown in real-time new year by following your timezone, this python code may help you. 
I developed it to propose my girl friend and celibrate happy new year 2023. let's check it out. 


##Follow instructions: 
In Python, you can use the datetime module to get the current time in Bangladesh Stander Time, and then use a while loop to continuously update and display the remaining time until the new year. Here's an example of how to do it:
 

#what you need?
1. Cold compiler like VS 
2. Pythone environment 
3. Install pytz and necessary library if needed during running codes



Remember: By inserting the aforementioned code inside the loop and pausing the loop for a little period of time between each iteration with the time.sleep() function, you can also use a while loop to update the countdown in real-time. You will be able to view the countdown update in real time as a result.
