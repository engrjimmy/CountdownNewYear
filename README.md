If you would like to countdown in real-time new year by following your time zone, this Python code may help you. 
I developed it to propose to my girlfriend and celebrate the happy new year 2023. Let's check it out. 


##Follow instructions: 
In Python, you can use the datetime module to get the current time in Bangladesh Standard Time and then use a while loop to continuously update and display the remaining time until the new year. Here's an example of how to do it:
 

#What do you need?
1. Cold compiler like VS 
2. Python environment 
3. Install pytz and necessary library if needed during running codes



Remember: By inserting the aforementioned code inside the loop and pausing the loop for a little period of time between each iteration, sleep() function, you can also use a while loop to update the countdown in real time. You will be able to view the countdown update in real-time as a result. 

#Download the above <Countdown.py> code and run it in your code compiler environment. You can use Google Collab server as well as Jupiter Notebook or any kind of platform. 

Note: I gave an example of how to countdown and propose to my girlfriend. Surprisingly, my girlfriend said 'yes' so good luck and happy codding, happy new year 2023.
